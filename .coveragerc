# Command line usage for pytest with coverage:
#   pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/ui_tests/ --cov=mcpstat --cov-report=term
# Alternatively, run coverage directly:
#   coverage run -m pytest --ignore=tests/ui_tests/
#   coverage report -i
# Skip the instruction below, because of "--include is ignored because --source is set (include-ignored)".
# Both --include and --source were specified, but only --source is used to limit code measurement scope.
# [run]
# include = mcpstat/*
